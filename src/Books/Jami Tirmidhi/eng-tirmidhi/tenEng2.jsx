					text: Abu Qatadah narrated that :he saw the Prophet urinating while facing the Qiblah. Qutaibah narrated that to us, he said: \Ibn Lahi'ah informed us.\ Jabir's Hadlth about the Prophet is more correct than the Hadith of Ibn Lahi'ah. Ibn Lahi'ah is weak according to the scholars of Hadith. He was graded weak by Yahya bin Sa'eed Al-Qattan, and others, [due to his memorization],
